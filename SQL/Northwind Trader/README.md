# ðŸš¢ Northwind Traders Analysis 

## Project description:
This project came from the Maven Northwind Challenge by Maven Analytics as a BI Developer for Northwind Traders. The challenge involved creating a top-level KPI dashboard to address the company's business needs and provide the executive team with valuable insights for informed decision-making.

The primary goal of the project was to develop a comprehensive overview of the company's performance in key areas, including sales trends, product performance, key customers, and shipping costs. By employing data analysis, visualization, and trend identification techniques, I extracted meaningful insights to drive strategic decision-making.

## Key Features

* Tracking of sales trends, product performance, key customers, and shipping costs.
* Utilization of dynamic data visualization for easy interpretation of insights.
* Generating recommendations based on identified trends and patterns.
* Providing observations and suggestions for improvement.

YTD Sales show a significant increase of 120.72% compared to the prior year, with YTD Orders also exhibiting a growth of 108.13%.
Noteworthy trends include an upward trajectory in sales and orders, along with a gradual decrease in average freight costs.
Key customers for the current year include QUICK-Stop, Ernst Handel, and Save-a-lot Markets, with the latter experiencing the highest increase in sales.
Beverages & Dairy Products dominate sales, accounting for nearly 45% of total sales, while Seafood demonstrates the highest growth rate (+285.16%).
United Package has the highest Freight per Order, extended delivery times, and a 5.13% rate of undelivered orders.
Suggestions

Renegotiate shipping contracts with United Package to secure more favorable rates based on our shipping volume and frequency.
Capitalize on the remarkable growth of the Seafood category (+285.16%) by strategically allocating additional resources to drive further growth.
Despite not currently being the top-selling product, Uncle Bob's impressive sales increase of 402% indicates untapped potential for future growth and profitability.
