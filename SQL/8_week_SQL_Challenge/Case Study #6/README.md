## B. Product Funnel Analysis
Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

* How many times was each product viewed?
* How many times was each product added to the cart?
* How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
* How many times was each product purchased?

~~~~sql
WITH product_view_add AS (
SELECT ph.product_id, ph.page_name as product_name, ph.product_category,
SUM(CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Page View' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as views,

FROM clique_bait.events e
JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier ei ON e.event_type = ei.event_type
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy ph ON e.page_id= ph.page_id
WHERE ph.product_id >0
GROUP BY ph.product_id, ph.page_name, ph.product_category
ORDER BY ph.product_id
)
, product_abandoned AS (
SELECT ph.product_id, ph.page_name as product_name, ph.product_category, COUNT(*) as abandoned
FROM clique_bait.events e
JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier as ei on e.event_type = ei.event_type
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy as ph ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
--1st layer: products are added to cart
WHERE ei.event_name = 'Add to Cart'
--2nd layer: add-to-cart products are NOT purchased
AND e.visit_id NOT IN (SELECT e.visit_id 
					FROM clique_bait.events e
				    JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier ei ON e.event_type = ei.event_type
				    WHERE ei.event_name = 'Purchase')
GROUP BY ph.product_id, ph.page_name, ph.product_category
ORDER BY ph.product_id
)
,product_purchased AS (
SELECT ph.product_id, ph.page_name as product_name, ph.product_category, COUNT(*) as purchases
FROM clique_bait.events e
JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier as ei on e.event_type = ei.event_type
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy as ph ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
--1st layer: products are added to cart

SELECT pv.*, pa.abandoned, pp.purchases
INTO product_info_sum

Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

~~~~sql
WITH product_view_add AS (
SELECT ph.product_category,
SUM(CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Page View' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as views,
SUM(CASE WHEN ei.event_name ='Add to Cart' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as cart_adds
FROM clique_bait.events e
JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier ei ON e.event_type = ei.event_type
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy ph ON e.page_id= ph.page_id
WHERE ph.product_id >0
GROUP BY ph.product_category
)
, product_abandoned AS (
SELECT ph.product_category, COUNT(*) as abandoned
FROM clique_bait.events e
JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier as ei on e.event_type = ei.event_type
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy as ph ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
--1st layer: products are added to cart
WHERE ei.event_name = 'Add to Cart'
--2nd layer: add-to-cart products are NOT purchased
AND e.visit_id NOT IN (SELECT e.visit_id 
					FROM clique_bait.events e
				    JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier ei ON e.event_type = ei.event_type
				    WHERE ei.event_name = 'Purchase')
GROUP BY ph.product_category
)
,product_purchased AS (
SELECT ph.product_category, COUNT(*) as purchases
FROM clique_bait.events e
JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier as ei on e.event_type = ei.event_type
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy as ph ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
--1st layer: products are added to cart
WHERE ei.event_name = 'Add to Cart'
--2nd layer: add-to-cart products are purchased
AND e.visit_id IN (SELECT e.visit_id 
					FROM clique_bait.events e
				    JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier ei ON e.event_type = ei.event_type
				    WHERE ei.event_name = 'Purchase')
GROUP BY ph.product_category
)
SELECT pv.*, pa.abandoned, pp.purchases
FROM product_view_add pv
JOIN product_abandoned pa ON pv.product_category = pa.product_category
JOIN product_purchased pp ON pv.product_category = pp.product_category
ORDER BY pv.product_category;

## C. Campaigns Analysis
Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique `visit_id` record and has the following columns:

* `user_id`
* `visit_id`
* `visit_start_time`: the earliest `event_time` for each visit
* `page_views`: count of page views for each visit
* `cart_adds`: count of product cart add events for each visit
* `purchase`: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
* `campaign_name`: map the visit to a campaign if the `visit_start_time` falls between the start_date and end_date
* `impression`: count of ad impressions for each visit
* `click`: count of ad clicks for each visit
* (Optional column)`cart_products`: a comma-separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the `sequence_number`)

~~~~sql
SELECT u.user_id, e.visit_id, 
MIN(e.event_time) as visit_start_time,
SUM(CASE WHEN ei.event_name ='Page View' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_views,
SUM(CASE WHEN ei.event_name ='Add to Cart' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_adds,
SUM(CASE WHEN ei.event_name ='Purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase,
ci.campaign_name,
SUM(CASE WHEN ei.event_name ='Ad Impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS impression,
SUM(CASE WHEN ei.event_name ='Ad Click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS click,
STRING_AGG(CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Add to Cart' THEN ph.page_name END, ', ' ORDER BY e.sequence_number ) 
 AS cart_products
INTO campaign_summary
FROM clique_bait.events e
JOIN clique_bait.users u ON e.cookie_id = u.cookie_id
JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier ei ON ei.event_type = e.event_type
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy ph ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
LEFT JOIN clique_bait.campaign_identifier ci ON e.event_time BETWEEN ci.start_date AND ci.end_date
GROUP BY u.user_id, e.visit_id,ci.campaign_name
ORDER BY u.user_id, e.visit_id;
~~~~

* 3,564 rows in total. The first 10 rows:
![Screenshot 2024-04-12 at 3 16 35â€¯PM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/f164bed8-7c7a-46cf-b769-2091400ee79c)

Some ideas you might want to investigate further include:

* Identifying users who have received impressions during each campaign period and comparing each metric with other users who did not have an impression event
* Does clicking on an impression lead to higher purchase rates?
* What is the uplift in purchase rate when comparing users who click on a campaign impression versus users who do not receive an impression? What if we compare them with users who just make an impression but do not click?
* What metrics can you use to quantify the success or failure of each campaign compared to each other?
