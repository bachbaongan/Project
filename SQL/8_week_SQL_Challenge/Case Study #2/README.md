## Business task: 
Danny is expanding his new Pizza Empire and at the same time, he wants to Uberize it, so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

FROM runner_orders_temp as r
JOIN customer_orders_temp as c ON c.order_id=r.order_id
WHERE distance != 0 
GROUP BY r.order_id, c.order_time, r.pickup_time
)
SELECT number_of_pizza, ROUND(AVG(prepare_time),0) as average_prep_time
FROM prep_time
GROUP BY number_of_pizza
ORDER BY number_of_pizza;
~~~~
### Output:
![cs2 bq3](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/6081c8e3-101c-40f8-9973-1704033f752e)

* Customer 104 resides closest to Pizza Runner HQ, with an average distance of 10km, while Customer 105 resides farthest away, at 25km

### 5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
~~~~sql
SELECT max(duration)-min(duration) as different_delivery_times
FROM runner_orders_temp as r
WHERE duration != 0;
~~~~
### Output:
![cs2 bq5](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/8fad26fe-c095-44c9-86fa-923631af14d6)

* The difference between the longest and shortest delivery time for all orders is 30 minutes

### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
~~~~sql
SELECT runner_id, order_id, 
ROUND(distance/(duration/60),1) as average_speed --Average_speed(km/h)
FROM runner_orders_temp as r
WHERE duration != 0 
ORDER BY runner_id, average_speed;
~~~~
### Output:
![cs2 bq6](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/9f3a30fc-c529-4f13-8d75-0028ec1990d4)

### 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

~~~~sql
SELECT runner_id, 
ROUND(CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN duration is null THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) AS DECIMAL)/COUNT(*)*100,0) as percentage_success
FROM runner_orders_temp 
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id;
~~~~
### Output:
![cs2 bq7](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/716590cb-4220-43e4-89be-aaed498bfa5f)

* Runner 1 has a 100% successful delivery.
* Runner 2 has a 75% successful delivery.
* Runner 3 has a 50% successful delivery
  
It's inaccurate to solely attribute successful delivery to runners since order cancellations are beyond the runner's control

## C. Ingredient Optimisation

~~~~sql
-- Create temporary pizza_recipes table where each row has pizza_id and its corresponding one topping id
CREATE TEMP TABLE pizza_recipes_temp AS (

## D. Pricing and Ratings
### 1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
~~~~sql

### 3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
~~~~sql
SET
  search_path = pizza_runner;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS runner_rating;
CREATE TABLE runner_rating (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "order_id" INTEGER,
    "customer_id" INTEGER,
    "runner_id" INTEGER,
    "rating" INTEGER,
    "rating_time" TIMESTAMP
  );
INSERT INTO
  runner_rating (
    "order_id",
    "customer_id",
    "runner_id",
    "rating",
    "rating_time"
  )
VALUES
  ('1', '101', '1', '5', '2021-01-01 19:33:53'),
  ('2', '101', '1', '4', '2021-01-01 20:25:12'),
  ('3', '102', '1', '4', '2021-01-03 10:14:51'),
  ('4', '103', '2', '3', '2021-01-04 16:46:25'),
  ('5', '104', '3', '5', '2021-01-08 23:08:44'),
  ('7', '105', '2', '2', '2021-01-08 23:53:35'),
  ('8', '102', '2', '3', '2021-01-10 12:34:26'),
  ('10', '104', '1', '5', '2021-01-11 20:02:35');

### 4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?

* customer_id
* order_id
* runner_id
* rating
* order_time
* pickup_time
* Time between order and pickup
* Delivery duration
* Average speed
* Total number of pizzas

~~~~sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.order_id, r.runner_id, rr.rating, c.order_time, r.pickup_time, 
r.pickup_time-c.order_time as time_between_order_pickup, 
r.duration as delivery_duration, 
ROUND(AVG(r.distance/(r.duration/60)),2) as average_speed,
COUNT(c.pizza_id) as total_number_pizza
FROM runner_rating rr
JOIN runner_orders_temp r on rr.runner_id =r.runner_id
JOIN customer_orders_temp c ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.duration !=0
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.order_id, r.runner_id, rr.rating, c.order_time, r.pickup_time,r.duration

### 5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
