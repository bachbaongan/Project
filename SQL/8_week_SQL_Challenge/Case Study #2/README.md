## Business task: 
Danny is expanding his new Pizza Empire and at the same time, he wants to Uberize it, so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

JOIN customer_orders_temp as c ON c.order_id=r.order_id
WHERE distance != 0 
GROUP BY r.order_id, c.order_time, r.pickup_time

* The difference between the longest and shortest delivery time for all orders is 30 minutes

### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
~~~~sql
SELECT runner_id, order_id, 
ROUND(distance/(duration/60),1) as average_speed --Average_speed(km/h)
FROM runner_orders_temp as r
WHERE duration != 0

### 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

~~~~sql
SELECT runner_id, 
ROUND(CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN duration is null THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) AS DECIMAL)/COUNT(*)*100,0) as percentage_success
FROM runner_orders_temp 
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id;
~~~~
### Output:
![cs2 bq7](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/716590cb-4220-43e4-89be-aaed498bfa5f)

* Runner 1 has a 100% successful delivery.
* Runner 2 has a 75% successful delivery.
* Runner 3 has a 50% successful delivery
It's inaccurate to solely attribute successful delivery to runners since order cancellations are beyond the runner's control
