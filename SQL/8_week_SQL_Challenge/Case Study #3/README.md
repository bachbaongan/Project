## Business task: 
Danny and his friends launched a new startup Foodie-Fi and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world.

This case study focuses on using subscription-style digital data to answer important business questions on customer journey, payments, and business performances.

## Entity Relationship Diagram
![case-study-3-erd](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/4b72fbc2-4a43-4510-ac8d-38028b734fb9)

### Table 1: Plans
Customers can choose which plans to join Foodie-Fi when they first sign up.

* Basic plan customers have limited access and can only stream their videos and is only available monthly at $9.90
* Pro plan customers have no watch time limits and can download videos for offline viewing.
* Pro plans start at $19.90 monthly or $199 for an annual subscription.
  
Customers can sign up for an initial 7-day free trial and will automatically continue with the pro monthly subscription plan unless they cancel, downgrade to basic or upgrade to an annual pro plan at any point during the trial.

When customers cancel their Foodie-Fi service - they will have a churn plan record with a null price but their plan will continue until the end of the billing period.

### Table 2: Subscriptions
Customer subscriptions show the **exact date** when their specific `plan_id` starts.

If customers downgrade from a pro plan or cancel their subscription - the higher plan will remain in place until the period is over - the `start_date` in the subscriptions table will reflect the date that the actual plan changes.

When customers upgrade their account from a basic plan to a pro or annual pro plan - the higher plan will take effect straight away.

When customers churn - they will keep their access until the end of their current billing period but the `start_date` will be technically the day they decide to cancel their service.

## Question and Solution
## A. Customer Journey
### Based on the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description of each customer’s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some join to make your explanations a bit easier!

* In 2020, there were no instances of customers downgraded from a pro monthly plan to a basis monthly plan
## C. Challenge Payment Question

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new `payments` table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the `subscriptions` table with the following requirements:

* monthly payments always occur on the same day of the month as the original `start_date` of any monthly paid plan
* upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
* upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also start at the end of the month period
* once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

### Example template:
customer_id|plan_id	|plan_name|	payment_date|	amount|	payment_order|
----|----|----|----|----|----
~~~~sql
WITH sub As (
SELECT s.customer_id, s.plan_id,
LAG(s.plan_id) OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.plan_id) as previous_plan,
p.plan_name,s.start_date,
GENERATE_SERIES(s.start_date, 
	CASE WHEN s.plan_id =3 THEN start_date 
		 WHEN s.plan_id =4 THEN NULL
		 WHEN LEAD(s.start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.start_date) IS NOT NULL 
				THEN LEAD(s.start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.start_date)
		 ELSE '2020-12-31' :: date
		 END, '1 month' + '1 minute':: interval) as payment_date,
p.price,
LAG(p.price) OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.plan_id) as previous_price	
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
JOIN foodie_fi.plans p ON p.plan_id= s.plan_id
WHERE s.start_date <='2020-12-31'
)
SELECT sub.customer_id, sub.plan_id, sub.plan_name, sub.payment_date, 
CASE WHEN sub.previous_plan != sub.plan_id 
AND DATE_PART('day',sub.payment_date -LAG(sub.payment_date) OVER (PARTITION BY sub.customer_id ORDER BY sub.plan_id)) <30
THEN sub.price-sub.previous_price ELSE price END as amount,
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY sub.customer_id ORDER BY sub.payment_date) as payment_order
FROM sub
WHERE sub.plan_id !=0;

## D. Outside The Box Questions
The following are open-ended questions which might be asked during a technical interview for this case study - there are no right or wrong answers, but answers that make sense from both a technical and a business perspective make an amazing impression!

### 1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?
~~~~sql
SELECT TO_CHAR(start_date,'YYYY-MM') as month_year,
COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as current_customer,
COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) - LAG(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)) OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(start_date,'YYYY-MM')) as number_customer_change,
CONCAT(ROUND(
	100.00*(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) - LAG(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)) OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(start_date,'YYYY-MM')))
	  /(LAG(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)) OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(start_date,'YYYY-MM')))
	  ,1),' %') as growth
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE plan_id NOT IN (0,4)
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(start_date,'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY month_year;
~~~~
#### Output:
![Screenshot 2024-04-01 at 5 11 23 PM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/70c8df75-eada-4634-8b6e-d7cc79d8f3c3)

### 2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess the performance of their overall business?

* Increase in Paid Membership
* Growth in Revenue
* Conversion Rate: Transition from Free Trial to Paid Membership
* Churn Rate: Number of Customers Cancelling Monthly Subscriptions and Their Subscription Plans
* Reasons for Churn
  
### 3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyze further to improve customer retention?

* Members who cancel their membership status
* Members who downgrade their plan, why they do not want to pay as before
* Members who upgrade their plan, what we can do to offer and keep more customers doing it
  
### 4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?
#### 1. How long have you been using Foodie-Fi? 

* Less than 1 Month
* 1–3 Months
* 3–6 Months
* 6–9 Months
* 9–12 Months
* More than 12 Months

#### 3. What made you cancel your subscription?
* Price
* Technical issues
* Customer support
* Found an alternative
* Others (please specify)

#### 4. What is something we could have done to prevent you from leaving? 
#### 5. Did you consider any alternatives before cancelling? If yes, which ones?
#### 6. Were there any product features that you expected but were not available?
#### 7. How likely are you to use our product again in the future?

#### 5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?

#### 1. Personalize Onboarding:

* Strategy: Tailor the onboarding process for new customers to help them quickly understand and derive value from your service.
* Validation:
  * Monitor user engagement during onboarding.
  * Measure time to value (how quickly users achieve their desired outcomes).
  * Analyze activation rates after personalized onboarding1.

#### 2. Contextual In-App Guidance:
 
* Strategy: Provide in-app guidance to assist users in navigating features and getting the most out of the platform.
* Validation:
  * Track feature adoption and usage.
  * Observe whether users follow the guidance provided.
  * Measure user satisfaction and success metrics1.

#### 3. Proactive Customer Service:

* Strategy: Anticipate user needs and address issues promptly.
* Validation:
  * Monitor response times to customer inquiries.
  * Collect feedback on customer service quality.
  * Track user satisfaction post-interaction1.

#### 4. Secondary Onboarding:

* Strategy: Continue educating users beyond initial onboarding to unlock additional value.
* Validation:
  * Measure engagement with secondary onboarding content.
  * Observe whether users explore advanced features.
  * Assess retention rates among users who complete secondary onboarding1.
#### 5. Gamification:

* Strategy: Apply game-like elements (such as rewards, badges, or challenges) to enhance user engagement.
* Validation:
  * Monitor participation in gamified activities.
  * Track user progress and achievements.
  * Assess whether gamification positively impacts retention1.
#### 6. Optimize Cancellation Flow:

* Strategy: Make the cancellation process smooth and gather feedback during cancellation.
* Validation:
  * Analyze the cancellation flow to identify friction points.
  * Collect reasons for cancellation.
  * Measure changes in cancellation rates after improvements.

#### To validate these strategies, Foodie-Fi can:

* Track Metrics: Regularly review churn rate, customer satisfaction scores, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and customer lifetime value (CLV).
* A/B Testing: Implement changes incrementally and compare outcomes using A/B tests.
* User Surveys: Gather insights from churned customers through in-app surveys or post-cancellation emails.
* Behavioral Analytics: Monitor user behaviour patterns to predict churn and assess the impact of implemented strategies
