## Business task: 
Danny and his friends launched a new startup Foodie-Fi and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world.

This case study focuses on using subscription-style digital data to answer important business questions on customer journey, payments, and business performances.

## Entity Relationship Diagram
![case-study-3-erd](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/4b72fbc2-4a43-4510-ac8d-38028b734fb9)

### Table 1: Plans
Customers can choose which plans to join Foodie-Fi when they first sign up.

* Basic plan customers have limited access and can only stream their videos and is only available monthly at $9.90
* Pro plan customers have no watch time limits and can download videos for offline viewing.
* Pro plans start at $19.90 monthly or $199 for an annual subscription.
  
Customers can sign up for an initial 7-day free trial and will automatically continue with the pro monthly subscription plan unless they cancel, downgrade to basic or upgrade to an annual pro plan at any point during the trial.

When customers cancel their Foodie-Fi service - they will have a churn plan record with a null price but their plan will continue until the end of the billing period.

### Table 2: Subscriptions
Customer subscriptions show the **exact date** when their specific `plan_id` starts.

If customers downgrade from a pro plan or cancel their subscription - the higher plan will remain in place until the period is over - the `start_date` in the subscriptions table will reflect the date that the actual plan changes.

When customers upgrade their account from a basic plan to a pro or annual pro plan - the higher plan will take effect straight away.

When customers churn - they will keep their access until the end of their current billing period but the `start_date` will be technically the day they decide to cancel their service.

## Question and Solution
## A. Customer Journey
### Based on the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description of each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some join to make your explanations a bit easier!

* Over 80% of Foodie-Fi's customer base is subscribed to paid plans, with the majority favouring Plans 1 and 2. However, there is notable room for enhancement in customer acquisition strategies for Plan 3, as it attracts only a minimal percentage of customers despite being a higher-priced option.

* In 2020, there were no instances customers downgraded from a pro monthly plan to a basis monthly plan
## C. Challenge Payment Question

### The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new `payments` table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the `subscriptions` table with the following requirements:

* monthly payments always occur on the same day of the month as the original `start_date` of any monthly paid plan
* upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
* upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also start at the end of the month period
* once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

### Example template:
customer_id|plan_id	|plan_name|	payment_date|	amount|	payment_order|
