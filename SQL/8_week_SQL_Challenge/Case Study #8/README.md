## Business task: 
Danny created Fresh Segments, a digital marketing agency that helps other businesses analyze trends in online ad click behaviour for their unique customer base.

Clients share their customer lists with the Fresh Segments team who then aggregate interest metrics and generate a single dataset worth of metrics for further analysis.

In particular - the composition and rankings for different interests are provided for each client showing the proportion of their customer list who interacted with online assets related to each interest for each month.

Danny has asked for your assistance to analyze aggregated metrics for an example client and provide some high-level insights about the customer list and their interests.

### Interest Metrics
This table contains information about aggregated interest metrics for a specific major client of Fresh Segments which makes up a large proportion of their customer base.

Each record in this table represents the performance of a specific `interest_id` based on the client‚Äôs customer base interest measured through clicks and interactions with specifically targeted advertising content.

##### For example - the first row of the `interest_metrics` table" 
In July 2018, the `composition` metric was 11.89, meaning that 11.89% of the client‚Äôs customer list interacted with the interest `interest_id` = 32486 - we can link `interest_id` to a separate mapping table to find the segment name called ‚ÄúVacation Rental Accommodation Researchers‚Äù

The `index_value` is 6.19, which means that the composition value is 6.19x the average `composition` value for all Fresh Segments clients‚Äô customers for this particular interest in July 2018.

The `ranking` and `percentage_ranking` relate to the order of `index_value` records each month and year.

### Interest Map
This mapping table links the `interest_id` with their relevant interest information. You will need to join this table onto the previous `interest_details` table to obtain the `interest_name` and any details about the summary information.

## Question and Solution
## A. Data Exploration and Cleansing
### 1. Update the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` table by modifying the `month_year` column to be a date data type with the start of the month
~~~~sql
--Modify the length of column `month_year` so it can store 15 characters
ALTER TABLE fresh_segments.interest_metrics ALTER COLUMN month_year TYPE VARCHAR(15);

--Update values in month_year column and add start date of month
UPDATE fresh_segments.interest_metrics
SET month_year =  TO_DATE(CONCAT('01-',month_year), 'DD-MM-YYYY');

--Convert month_year to DATE
ALTER TABLE fresh_segments.interest_metrics
ALTER COLUMN month_year TYPE DATE USING month_year::date;

SELECT * FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics;
~~~~
![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 1 41 49‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/693d15ca-8cce-4a7d-b4c9-738a5ff7dd21)

### 2. What is the count of records in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` for each `month_year` value sorted in chronological order (earliest to latest) with the null values appearing first?
~~~~sql
SELECT month_year, COUNT(*)
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
GROUP BY month_year
ORDER BY month_year NULLS first;
~~~~
![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 1 42 02‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/e7df0d61-8e8a-4046-a389-a3ff456041a3)

### 3. What do you think we should do with these null values in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics`?
~~~~sql
SELECT *
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE month_year IS NULL
ORDER BY interest_id;
~~~~
![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 1 45 46‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/15970617-78f9-437f-b9ec-26db1778d080)

Since the values in fields like composition, index_value, ranking, and percentile_ranking lack significance 
without the specific interest_id, I will remove any rows where interest_id is null.

~~~~sql
DELETE FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id IS NULL;
~~~~

### 4. How many `interest_id` values exist in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` table but not in the fresh_segments.interest_map table? What about the other way around?
~~~~sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT me.interest_id) as metric_id_count,
COUNT(DISTINCT ma.id) as map_id_count,
SUM(CASE WHEN me.interest_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) as not_in_metric,
SUM(CASE WHEN ma.id IS NULL THEN 1 END) as not_in_map
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics me
FULL JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map ma ON me.interest_id = ma.id;
~~~~
![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 2 05 29‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/5a639369-0b6c-4a0d-bec1-487702ca5d09)

* There are 1209 `id` in table `interest_map`.
* There are 1202 `interest_id` in table `interest_metrics`.
* There are 7 `id` appearing in table `interest_map` but not appearing in `interest_id` of table `interest_metrics` .
* No `interest_id` values appear in table `interest_metrics` but don't appear in `id` of table interest_map.
  
### 5. Summarise the id values in the `fresh_segments.interest_map` by its total record count in this table
~~~~sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) as count_id
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map;
~~~~
![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 2 06 47‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/12cd4c95-82a2-4600-a267-f1d938685f5f)

### 6. What sort of table join should we perform for our analysis and why? Check your logic by checking the rows where `interest_id = 21246` in your joined output and include all columns from fresh_segments.interest_metrics and all columns from `fresh_segments.interest_map` except the `id` column.
~~~~sql
--We should be using INNER JOIN to perform our analysis.
SELECT * 
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics me
JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map ma ON me.interest_id = ma.id
WHERE me.interest_id = 21246;
~~~~
![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 2 12 19‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/3bfdda08-7bb5-47dc-bbc1-8f20269684f6)

### 7. Are there any records in your joined table where the month_year value is before the `created_at` value from the `fresh_segments.interest_map` table? Do you think these values are valid and why?
~~~~sql
SELECT COUNT(*)  as cnt
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics me
JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map ma ON me.interest_id = ma.id
WHERE me.month_year < ma.created_at;
~~~~
![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 2 14 09‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/684a5705-ad2f-496a-b989-5e17e2d1c962)

There are 188 `month_year` values that are before `created_at` values. However, it may be the case that those 188 created_at values were created at the same month as `month_year` values. The reason is that `month_year` values were set on the first date of the month by default in Question 1.

To check that, we turn the `create_at` to the first date of the month:
~~~~sql
SELECT COUNT(*)  as cnt
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics me
JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map ma ON me.interest_id = ma.id
WHERE me.month_year < CAST(CONCAT('01-', EXTRACT(MONTH FROM ma.created_at),'-',EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ma.created_at) ) AS DATE);
~~~~
![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 2 18 40‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/9abe0208-714c-46b6-a35c-3f39ed662969)

Since all month_year and created_at were at the same month, these values are valid.

## B. Interest Analysis
### 1. Which interests have been present in all `month_year` dates in our dataset?
~~~~sql
--Find how many unique month_year dates in our dataset
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT month_year) as unique_month_year
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics;
~~~~
![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 2 35 51‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/40ecbd22-5f86-4714-be2b-3e9e0b651d24)

There are 14 unique `month_year` in our dataset
~~~~sql
--Find all interest_id that have 14 month_year 
WITH interest_month_count AS (
SELECT interest_id, COUNT(month_year) AS cnt
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
GROUP BY interest_id
HAVING COUNT(month_year) = 14
)
SELECT COUNT(*) as number_interest_all_month
FROM interest_month_count;
~~~~
![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 2 51 49‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/44ca5eb7-f02e-4fdf-becf-3e14e3da160e)

There are 480 interests are present in all the `month_year` dates
### 2. Using this same `total_months` measure - calculate the cumulative percentage of all records starting at 14 months - which `total_months` value passes the 90% cumulative percentage value?
~~~~sql
WITH interest_month AS (
SELECT interest_id, COUNT(month_year) AS total_months
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
GROUP BY interest_id
)
, interest_count AS (
SELECT total_months, COUNT(interest_id) as interests
FROM interest_month
GROUP BY total_months
ORDER BY total_months DESC
)
SELECT total_months,interests,
ROUND(100.00*SUM(interests) OVER(ORDER BY total_months DESC)/SUM(interests) OVER (),2) as cumulative_percentage
FROM interest_count;
~~~~
![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 2 43 41‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/e95b03a9-adc9-4802-b605-2b2e80a538be)

Interests that have been active for a total of 6 months or more exhibit a cumulative percentage of 90% or higher. Conversely, interests with fewer than 6 months of activity warrant investigation to enhance their performance in terms of clicks and customer interactions.

### 3. If we were to remove all `interest_id` values which are lower than the `total_months` value we found in the previous question - how many total data points would we be removing?
~~~~sql
WITH interest_month AS (
SELECT interest_id, COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) AS total_months
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY interest_id
)
SELECT COUNT(interest_id) as interests,
COUNT(DISTINCT interest_id) as unique_interest
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id IN ( SELECT interest_id 
					   FROM interest_month 
					   WHERE total_months<6);
~~~~
![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 2 56 50‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/971b8c8f-b8b8-486c-a05b-5e484f45628c)

If we removed all 110 `interest_id` values that are below 6 months in the table interest_metrics, 400 data points would be removed.
### 4. Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a business perspective? Use an example where there are all 14 months present to a removed `interest` example for your arguments - think about what it means to have fewer months present from a segment perspective.

When checking the timeline of our dataset, I realized that this business had just started 1 year and 1 month. The timeline was too short to confirm whether the customer who didn't contribute too much to the business outcome will go back to the business or not. Therefore, from a business perspective, we shouldn't remove these data points.

~~~~sql
SELECT 
  MIN(month_year) AS first_date,
  MAX(month_year) AS last_date
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics;
~~~~
![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 2 59 33‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/49f0dad6-8e89-4ee2-acde-1f95530bcd32)
~~~~sql
--When total_months = 14
SELECT month_year, COUNT(DISTINCT interest_id) as interest_count,
MIN(ranking) as highest_ranking,
MAX(composition) as composition_max,
MAX(index_value) as index_max
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id IN (SELECT interest_id 
					  FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics 
					  WHERE interest_id IS NOT NULL 
					  GROUP BY interest_id 
					  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) =14)
GROUP BY month_year
ORDER BY month_year, highest_ranking;
~~~~
![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 3 20 58‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/dabd51e4-0ef7-4119-8fa8-ecd22442dc58)

~~~~sql
--When total_months = 1
SELECT month_year, COUNT(DISTINCT interest_id) as interest_count,
MIN(ranking) as highest_ranking,
MAX(composition) as composition_max,
MAX(index_value) as index_max
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id IN (SELECT interest_id 
					  FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics 
					  WHERE interest_id IS NOT NULL 
					  GROUP BY interest_id 
					  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) =1)
GROUP BY month_year
ORDER BY month_year, highest_ranking;
~~~~
![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 3 21 34‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/d0a68a99-17a2-4c23-9dcf-3d7b485ba2c8)

In case we want to find the average, maximum or minimum of ranking, composition or index_value for each interest in every month, interest that doesn't have 14 months would create an uneven distribution of observations because we don't have data on these months. Therefore, we should keep these data points in the segment analysis to have a correct view of the overall interest of customers.


### 5. After removing these interests - how many unique interests are there for each month?
As mentioned before, instead of deleting interests below 6 months, I will create a temporary table temp_interest_metrics excluded them for the segment analysis.

~~~~sql
SELECT *
INTO temp_interest_metrics
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id NOT IN (SELECT interest_id 
						  FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics 
						  WHERE interest_id IS NOT NULL 
						  GROUP BY interest_id 
						  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) <6);
~~~~
~~~~sql
SELECT COUNT(interest_id) as all_interest,
COUNT(DISTINCT interest_id) as unique_interest
FROM temp_interest_metrics;
~~~~
![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 3 27 45‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/assets/144385168/7a36c0a1-5f89-4800-86bc-648f5e4a682f)

We can notice that the number of unique interests has dropped from 1202 (Question 4 part A) to 1092, which is 110 interests corresponding to 400 data points (Question 3 this part).

~~~~sql
--The number of unique interests for each month after removing:
SELECT month_year,COUNT(DISTINCT interest_id) AS unique_interests
FROM temp_interest_metrics
WHERE month_year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY month_year
ORDER BY month_year;

## C. Segment Analysis
### 1. Using our filtered dataset by removing the interests with less than 6 months' worth of data, which are the top 10 and bottom 10 interests which have the largest composition values in any `month_year`? Only use the maximum composition value for each interest but you must keep the corresponding `month_year`

TOP 10 interests that have the largest composition values
~~~~sql

### 4. For the 5 interests found in the previous question - what were the minimum and maximum `percentile_ranking` values for each interest and its corresponding `year_month` value? Can you describe what is happening for these 5 interests?

We can see that the the range between the maximum and minimum percentile_ranking of 5 interests in the table above is very large and the months of the maximum and minimum values are different.  these interests may have seasonal demand or there are other underlying reasons related to products, services or prices that we should investigate further.

## D. Index Analysis
The `index_value` is a measure which can be used to reverse calculate the average composition for Fresh Segments‚Äô clients.

Average composition can be calculated by dividing the `composition` column by the `index_value` column rounded to 2 decimal places.

### 1. What are the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?
~~~~sql

~~~~

### 2. For all of these top 10 interests - which interest appears the most often?
~~~~sql

~~~~

### 3. What is the average of the average composition for the top 10 interests for each month?
~~~~sql

~~~~

### 4. What is the 3-month rolling average of the max average composition value from September 2018 to August 2019 and include the previous top-ranking interests in the same output shown below?

month_year	|interest_name	|max_index_composition	|3_month_moving_avg	|1_month_ago	|2_months_ago
