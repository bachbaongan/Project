# 🏆 8-Week-SQL-Challenge

I've included the solutions to the eight case studies from the [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com). 

These solutions emphasize my proficiency in tackling varied SQL challenges, demonstrating my adeptness in formulating SQL queries and problem-solving using PostgreSQL to tackle this case study.

🔆 I'd like to express my gratitude to [Katie Huang](https://github.com/katiehuangx) for motivating me to undertake this challenge, and special thanks to [Danny Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/company/datawithdanny/) for creating this engaging interactive task.
