# üçú Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny‚Äôs Diner needs your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from its few months of operation but has no idea how to use its data to help it run the business.

Let's view the [case study](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/) and [my solution](https://github.com/bachbaongan/Portfolio_Data/tree/main/SQL/8_week_SQL_Challenge/Case%20study%20%231) for Danny.

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

Data Mart is Danny‚Äôs latest venture and after running international operations for his online supermarket that specializes in fresh produce - Danny is asking for your support to analyze his sales performance.

In June 2020 - large-scale supply changes were made at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm to the customer.

Danny needs your help to quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance of Data Mart and its separate business areas.

The key business questions he wants you to help him answer are the following:

* What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?
* Which platform, region, segment and customer types were impacted most by this change?
* What can we do about the future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimize the impact on sales?

Danny created Fresh Segments, a digital marketing agency that helps other businesses analyze trends in online ad click behaviour for their unique customer base.

Clients share their customer lists with the Fresh Segments team who then aggregate interest metrics and generate a single dataset worth of metrics for further analysis.

In particular - the composition and rankings for different interests are provided for each client showing the proportion of their customer list who interacted with online assets related to each interest for each month.
