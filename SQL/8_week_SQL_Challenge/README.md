Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny’s Diner needs your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from its few months of operation but has no idea how to use its data to help it run the business.
