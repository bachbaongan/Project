## Business task: 
Data Mart is Dannyâ€™s latest venture and after running international operations for his online supermarket that specializes in fresh produce - Danny is asking for your support to analyze his sales performance.

In June 2020 - large-scale supply changes were made at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm to the customer.

Danny needs your help to quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance of Data Mart and its separate business areas.

The key business questions he wants you to help him answer are the following:

* What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?
* Which platform, region, segment and customer types were impacted most by this change?
* What can we do about the future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimize the impact on sales?

## Column Dictionary

The columns are pretty self-explanatory based on the column names but here are some further details about the dataset:

* Data Mart has international operations using a multi-`region` strategy
* Data Mart has both, a retail and online `platform` in the form of a Shopify storefront to serve their customers
* Customer `segment` and `customer_type` data relates to personal age and demographic information that is shared with Data Mart
* `transactions` is the count of unique purchases made through Data Mart and `sales` is the actual dollar amount of purchases

Each record in the dataset is related to a specific aggregated slice of the underlying sales data rolled up into a `week_date` value which represents the start of the sales week.

10 random rows are shown in the table output below from `data_mart.weekly_sales`:

## Question and Solution
## A. Data Cleansing Steps
In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named `clean_weekly_sales`:

* Convert the week_date to a DATE format
* Add a `week_number` as the second column for each `week_date` value, for example, any value from the 1st of January to the 7th of January will be 1, the 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
* Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column
* Add a `calendar_year` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
* Add a new column called `age_band` after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the `segment` value

segment	| age_band
---|---
1|Young Adults
2|Middle Aged
3 or 4|Retirees

* Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:
  
segment	| demographic
---|---
C |	Couples
F	| Families

* Ensure all `null` string values with an "unknown" string value in the original `segment` column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns
* Generate a new `avg_transaction` column as the sales value divided by `transactions` rounded to 2 decimal places for each record
