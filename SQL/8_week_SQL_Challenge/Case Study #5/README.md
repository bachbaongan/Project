## Business task: 
Data Mart is Dannyâ€™s latest venture and after running international operations for his online supermarket that specializes in fresh produce - Danny is asking for your support to analyze his sales performance.

In June 2020 - large-scale supply changes were made at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm to the customer.

Danny needs your help to quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance of Data Mart and its separate business areas.

The key business questions he wants you to help him answer are the following:

* What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?
* Which platform, region, segment and customer types were impacted most by this change?
* What can we do about the future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimize the impact on sales?

## Column Dictionary

The columns are pretty self-explanatory based on the column names but here are some further details about the dataset:

* Data Mart has international operations using a multi-`region` strategy
* Data Mart has both, a retail and online `platform` in the form of a Shopify storefront to serve their customers
* Customer `segment` and `customer_type` data relates to personal age and demographic information that is shared with Data Mart
* `transactions` is the count of unique purchases made through Data Mart and `sales` is the actual dollar amount of purchases

Each record in the dataset is related to a specific aggregated slice of the underlying sales data rolled up into a `week_date` value which represents the start of the sales week.

10 random rows are shown in the table output below from `data_mart.weekly_sales`:
