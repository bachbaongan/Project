## Introduction:
Amazon, an e-commerce platform, offers millions of products for sale. Notably, Jeff Bezos initially started selling books on Amazon before becoming the world's wealthiest individual. Let's examine the top 50 bestselling books on Amazon to gain valuable insights from them.

## Dataset:
Using the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chriskachmar/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2022) to conduct my analysis. This dataset provides information on the top 50 bestselling books on Amazon over the past 14 years, including the current year. It contains details such as the title, author, rating, price, and genre of each book. I extend my gratitude to the author for sharing this valuable data.

## Data analysis:
There are 6 questions I will answer here:

##### 1. Who are the bestseller Authors and Rating?
##### 2. What is the average price of books within each genre?
##### 3. What is the average number of reviews/user ratings for books in each genre?
##### 4. Which years had the lowest average ratings among the top 50 bestselling books?
##### 5. What book has the highest review?
##### 6. Can we identify any sales trends from the dataset?

###  Visualizing the data
I will utilize Tableau to present and answer the questions I've posed.

### Analyzing results:
### 1. Who are the bestseller Authors and Rating?
Jeff Kinney emerged as the top bestselling author on the Amazon platform from 2009 to 2022, with 14 books and an impressive average user rating of 4.81. He is followed by Rick Riordan, Dav Pikey, Stephenie Meyer, and Bill O'Reilly. 
The majority of bestselling authors were in the Fiction category.

### 2. What is the average price of books within each genre?
The data indicates that over the period examined, non-fiction literature consistently retailed at a higher average price, except in the first year of data (2009). I have included a graph for an overall comparison and a bar chart with adjustable years to illustrate the exact differences.


### 3. What is the average number of reviews/user ratings  for books in each genre?
As part of the dashboard, I incorporated an adjustment button to toggle the User Rating vs Reviews bar-line chart between viewing All books (both Fiction and Non-Fiction), Non-Fiction only, and Fiction only. By doing so, we can observe the disparities in ratings and reviews based on the genre of the book.

### 4. Which years had the lowest average ratings among the top 50 bestselling books?
Based on the dashboard display, when using the 'All' filter, we observe that 2012 has the lowest average user rating at 4.53, while the highest ratings are jointly held by 2019 and 2021, both at 4.74.

### 5. Were there any titles that appeared in multiple years of the ranking?

### 6. Can we identify any sales trends from the dataset?
Yes, we can indeed observe a sales trend. My reasoning for this is the sudden spike in total book reviews that appeared to commence in 2019–2020, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of lockdown policies worldwide.
This indicates that consumers turned to literature to occupy themselves, which appears to be a popular choice, considering the significant increase in total reviews from 794,917 in 2019 to 2,617,497 in 2020. It's possible that people used their free time during the pandemic to write book reviews, but the sudden spike likely correlated with increased sales during this period.
